# Social-Media-User-Performance-and-Dashboards

# Overview
In this project, I analyzed the Social Media User Performance dataset, extracted key insights, and created different types of charts. In the last business, Gorth created an interactive dashboard.

# Objectives
Identify which platform is being used the most? Define how much Average time is spent on each platform? Platform Popularity. Finding Insight for business help. Dataset Sources and Structure source of the dataset The dataset has been taken from Kaggle Data Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umeradnaan/daily-social-media-active-users
Dataset File Type: CSV Structure of the dataset The dataset has 10,000 rows and 7 columns.

# Columns Information :
Platform: The social media platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) Owner: The company or entity that owns the platform (e.g., Meta, Google, ByteDance) Primary Usage: Describes the platformâ€™s main functionality (e.g., social networking, video sharing) Country: The userâ€™s location, simulated from a global range Daily Time Spent (min): The amount of time (in minutes) the user spends daily on the platform Verified Account: Indicates whether the user has a verified account Date Joined: The simulated date the user joined the platform
Data Cleaning
It is very important for data analysis that the data set is clean, one of the steps to clean the data set is to clean the data. For example, removing missing values â€‹â€‹or filling the data set, removing duplicate values, removing or identifying outliers. If the data set is not clean, then many problems will be faced in the analysis or building machine learning models. Therefore, cleaning the data set is one of the most important steps in data analysis or creating dashboards or building machine learning models. Missing Values Handling After checking for missing values â€‹â€‹in the dataset, there are no missing values â€‹â€‹in the dataset.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data analysis project, as it prepares raw data for accurate and reliable analysis. Outlier Remove: The Dataset doesn't have any outliers
Change datatype: "Data Joined" columns datatype is object, convert this datatype to pandas datetime
